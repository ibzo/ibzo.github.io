                This project is a solo project, with a single player mode as well as a networked multiplayer mode, where I 
                used photon to host the game. The game is still very much early in development, with few more features to add.

                The game allows the character to play as a chicken, in a battle against enemy chickens. Currently, the single 
                player mode is close to completion, with a few bugs to fix. The multiplayer mode is still in development, 
                so far having one level. The main focus on this project is working on the networked features.

            <h3>Player Move & Shoot</h3>

            <img src="Images/ChickshotScrnShots/Code/The 'Update()' Function.png">
            <img src="Images/ChickshotScrnShots/Code/'Move()' Method.png">
            <img src="Images/ChickshotScrnShots/Code/'Fire()' Method.png">

            <p>
                Move() is called in the update() method within the player script to allow the player to move the character 
                around in any frame when initiate a move input. The character model will rotate to the direction it is 
                moving in, so that the model is moving forward. When the player presses the space key, the fire() method is 
                called. Everytime the player fires a bullet, there is a cooldown to regulate when the player can fire again. 
                nextFireTime is the condition which the code uses so the player cannot spam fire. After a shot, nextFireTime 
                equates to the current time elapsed plus the FireRate. So the next shot can only be fired when nextFireTime 
                is less than the elapsed time. Next, the bullet prefab is instantiated in the bullet position (which is 
                always infront of the player model). A shooting sound and a gunsmoke VFX are also played to show the bullet 
                being shot. Now that the player has been implemented, the next obvious step was to have a bullet that not 
                only appears, but travels in the direction it was shot until it hits something.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/ChickshotScrnShots/Code/Bullet Script.png">

            <p>
                I implemented the bullet such that it would continue to travel in the original direction it was shot. But of 
                course, the bullet must hit something, whether that be an enemy, another player, or the outer wall. So I 
                used OnCollisionEnter() so that if anything enters the bullet's collision box, it would be destroyed. There 
                would be a sound and VFX when the bullet is destroyed to emphasize the end of the bullet's path.

            <h3>Camera</h3>

            <p>
                It is good for the player to move and shoot. But what good is it if you cannot see them as they move around 
                the map. For this purpose, I made a script for the camera.
            </p>

            <p>
                offset value is the difference between the position of the player and the camera. This is sorted out in the 
                start() function. This is exactly how it will remain throughout, by making the camera position equal to the 
                player position, then adding the offset. This is done at every frame, keep the camera constantly.
            </p>

            <h3>Enemy</h3>
            
            <p>
                Of course, when it comes to a shooter, you have to have an enemy to aim and shoot at. So I created some 
                enemies. I started off in a similar manner to the player, but I added a simple enemy AI, which would keep 
                an enemy idle until the player is close enough. Then the enemy would turn towards the player and begin to 
                fire bullets are a slow rate.
            </p>

            <h3>Health & Damage</h3>

            <p>
                Now that both the enemy and player could shoot, it was time to implement health and damage. I started with 
                the enemy, making sure that when the player's bullet enters an enemy's collision box, it would call the 
                TakeDamage() method. This is where the damage value assigned to the projectile will be taken away from the 
                enemy health. If the health value had reached 0, it would call the EnemyDied() method and that enemy will 
                be destroyed.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/ChickshotScrnShots/Code/Enemy damage mechanic.png">
            
            <p>
                That also means that the same must be done if the player takes too much damage. If the player dies, the game 
                object is deleted.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/ChickshotScrnShots/Code/Player damage mechanic.png">

            <p>
                I am yet to implement a game over screen, where the player will be able to restart the game or return back 
                to the main menu.
