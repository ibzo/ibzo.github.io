                This project is a solo project, made in Visual Studio with C++ (OpenGL, FreeGLUT library). It is a simple 
                arcade game, taking inspiration from the likes of Asteroids, Pac-Man and Space Invaders.

                The game allows the player to control a car. The player starts at the red gate and has to drive to the opposite 
                green gate, making sure they avoid all the obstacles in their way. They are given points when they reach the 
                green gate, but points are taken away if they crash into an obstacle.

            <h3>Player Movement</h3>

            <p>
                I had some difficulty implementing the movement due to the nature of OpenGL. Since I had to provide all the 
                vertices for the car, I had to make calculations of how the car would respond to certain actions the player 
                would input and draw a new car accordingly. 
            </p>

            <h3>Collisions</h3>

            <p>
                The next challenge for me was collisions. As the car driving around alone would be boring, I added obstacles 
                which the player would have to avoid. The car would first have to spawn in a clear area. I drew an invisible 
                border around the car to detect collisions with nearby obstacles, to avoid the car spawning on top of them. 
                I used this method every time I wanted to check the car's surroundings for obstacles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Drawing the obstacles was the same as drawing the car. The difference was that the obstacles were stationary but 
                were spawned at random (as well as multiple obstacles). This was difficult to implement as it meant that I had 
                to randomly spawn the obstacles, and if they collided with anything in the level bounds, they would have to be 
                redrawn.
