                This is a solo project made with C# in unity. MazeShooter is a single player game I made as a simple project 
                to test out procedural terrain generation. I also have the intention of implementing pathfinding algorithms 
                to apply to the AI in further development.

            <p id="projectSummary">
                The game is still in early development. The features mentioned are currently being implemented alongside 
                other features, including increasing difficulty of the game, variety of levels (possible even larger), etc.

            <h3>AI</h3>

            <p>
                AI is usally the most difficult part for me to implement, as it can be hard to find existing bugs 
                in it's code. I find testing to be much more time consuming and usual. The game is still in early 
                development, however I have already encounter some issues in attempting to code the patrol, attack 
                and search status of the enemy. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The enemy should randomly patrol. When the player is in sight, it's status should change to attack, 
                where it follows the player at a certain distance, whilst shooting. If the player evades the enemy's 
                line of sight, it will stop to search for the player. If it fails to find the player, it returns to 
                it's patrol. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am currently unable to show my code, but I hope to soon be able to show the fruits of my labour.
            </p>

            <h3>Shooting Mechanics</h3>

            <p>
                When programming the mechanics for shooting, I had to ensure that the bullet prefabs were initialised 
                as the shoot method is called. The player and enamy bullets have different characteristics, so 
                I had to specifically load the appropriate script.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In addition, I did not want too many bullets on screen at once. So I set a fire rate for both the player 
                and the enemy. A bullet would not be able to be shot, unless the accumulated time since the last shot 
                had reached the rate rate time.
            </p>

            <h3>Environmental Movement</h3>

            <p>
                As the player moves around, they will come across different surfaces in the environment. They have 
                different properties, so some will slow down the one walking on that tile. As the player moves around, 
                if the collision box they enter belongs to a specific tile, the speed modifier on that tile will be 
                applied to the speed of the player. Each tile has a tag to identify it.
